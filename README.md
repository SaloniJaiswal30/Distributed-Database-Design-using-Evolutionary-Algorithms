# Distributed-Database-Design-using-Evolutionary-Algorithms
Project deals with allocation of fragments on different sites in the context of relational database. I had implemented a genetic algorithm to allocate the fragments on the basis of cost obtained from fitness function. 
## Technology Used
Python3
## Description
This is a quadratic assignment problem for which evalutionary algorithm is used i.e genetic algorithm to solve it. A partially mapped crossover (PMX) is used for the GA because it is one of the best performing operators for a QAP solution.
## Installation
- Flow and distance cost matrix can be changed according to need.
- Size of chromosome is fixed i.e 9
